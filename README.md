# pet-tracker-app

For our project, we went towards building an app that is designed to track vet visits for your pets! This solves the problem of managing your vet visits, as it can be hard keeping up on.

Users can use this app by creating an account by entering a username and password. Once making an account, users can add a pet to their account by clicking the "add new pet" button. Now, they are able to input their pet's information, such as name, color, type of pet, and date of birth. A user is able to edit pet info as well. Once a pet has been added, users can add more pets if they want to track more.

When they are ready, users can click on a pet and click the "add vet visit" button, in which they will be prompted to fill out informatino about their vet visit, such as what day the visit took place, what happened at the vet visit, and the recorded weight of the pet. Users are able to add more vet visits, or update one if the information changes.
